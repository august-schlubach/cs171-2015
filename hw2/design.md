# Open Design 

My intention with the open design is to take a SVG of world countries and light up trade partners when you mouse over them. This is intended to give a spatial component to trade which is lacking in the circular design. As far as a design I think it's fairly obvious (which is not a bad thing), but technically it will involve some interesting explorations.

# Visual Design

* map of the world

# Interaction

* mouse over
* highlight trade partners

# Further Explorations

* changing visual variables such as color or texture depending on volume of trade
