## Homework 2 Answers

0.1 The horizontal and vertical position of the nodes specify a topological relationship. Topological designs can be used to specify the path between nodes, such as in a network diagram or a subway map. They can also be used for spatial design, such as a rendering of flight paths between cities, though the data in the example uses arbitrary values.

0.2 Other visual variables that could be used in the example design:

* shape 
* value (brightness of lines and/or nodes)
* texture (variation of line width)
* orientation (especially in conjunction with shape)
* connection

0.3 (In)Depenency

Dependent

* connection

Independent

* orientation
* color
* position
* texture
* size
* shape
* value

The dependency on connection occurs because the changing the value of either connected node could change the value of the connection.

1.1 Ordinal scale produces a clear readout of names but provides no sense of the difference between individual data points. Linear scale gives a clear sense of the relative difference between data points but can be hard to read (in this configuration at least) when data are clustered.

1.2 Because scatterplots are created using cartesian coordinates, quantitative data is the appropriate input. Ordinal data, for example, would be difficult to plot without assigning aribrary quantitative values (small=1, medium=2, etc.).

2.1 The advantage of layouts is that they provide methods for quickly performing standard visualization tasks such as pie charts, historgrams, trees, etc.

downside is that you are constrained by the limitations of the layout and forced into using its methods even if they don't naturally fit your needs.
