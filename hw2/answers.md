## Homework 2 Answers

0.1 The horizontal and vertical position of the nodes specify a topological relationship. Topological designs can be used to specify the path between nodes, such as in a network diagram or a subway map. They can also be used for spatial design, such as a rendering of flight paths between cities, though the data in the example uses arbitrary values.

0.2 Other visual variables that could be used in the example design:

* shape 
* value (brightness of lines and/or nodes)
* texture (variation of line width)
* orientation (especially in conjunction with shape)
* connection

0.3 (In)Depenency

Dependent

* connection

Independent

* orientation
* color
* position
* texture
* size
* shape
* value

The dependency on connection occurs because the changing the value of either connected node could change the value of the connection.
