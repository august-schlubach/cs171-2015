### Q5a
**Question:** Choose __one__ comparison scenario and create at least three alternative designs that would allow this comparison.

I chose to create a design that provides a side-by-side comparison of two regions.

### Q5b
**Question:** Implement one design in your visualization for **PrioVis** and explain why you have chosen this design.

I tried both relative and absolute scaling on prioVis and found relative to be better overall, however you lose a sense of scale when you scrub the brush east-west. I went through a number of designs that would allow me to freeze the current data (and preserve its scale) without being overly cumbersome. I went with the circle because I thought they provided the relevant information to the vis without being too distracting or taking away from the overall design.

### Q5c
**Question:** As a very minimal case study submit a screenshot of an interesting pattern which you have found with your method and briefly describe the pattern.

I added two screenshots to the designStudio directory. The first is an initial selection of about a month and a half's worth of data. The second is the same window moved to another part of countVis that appears to have the same amount of activity. The interesting thing that I was able to pick up is the change in priorities over the course of eight months that would have otherwise been hard to detect.

Scrubbing the data with this comparison mechanism I noticed that though there is a strong preference for education, healthcare, and good government in all segments of the data it appears to be more pronounced in the latter 2/3 of the data than in the first third.
